# 🖼️ Tile by Nehir – Bootstrap Layout Starter

Welcome to your Bootstrap layout activity! This project is part of **LiveLab 5** in the Global Career Accelerator.

You’ll be building a responsive image layout inspired by a fictional design studio called _Tile by Nehir_, using **Bootstrap** and **AI tools like GitHub Copilot**.

## 🚀 Quick Start in Codespaces

Use the **starter launcher** (`index.html` in the root) to preview your activity files in Live Server.

### ✅ To launch your activity:

1. In Codespaces, **right-click** `index.html` in the root folder
2. 2. Choose the option that says either:
   - `Preview with Live Server`  
   - **or** `Show Preview`  
   _(the wording might be slightly different — either one works!)_
3. A new browser tab or side panel will open with two links:
   - `🖼️ Tile by Nehir Starter` → opens `tile-activity/tile.html`
   - `🌀 Parallax Level-Up` → opens `level-up-parallax/parallax.html`

---

## 📁 What Files to Edit

> ✅ You **should only edit**:
>
> - `tile-activity/tile.html` and `tile-style.css` — main layout activity
> - `level-up-parallax/parallax.html` and `parallax-style.css` — bonus challenge (optional)

> 🚫 **Do not edit**:
> - `index.html` in the root — it’s just a launcher
> - Stylesheets outside your assigned activity folder

## 🧰 Tools You Already Have in Codespaces

You’re already set up with everything you need:

- ✅ **GitHub Copilot** is ready to use — try asking it to suggest layout improvements or fix spacing
- ✅ **Live Preview** is built-in — just right-click your HTML file and choose `Preview with Live Server` or `Show Preview`  
  _(Either one works — the option name might vary a little)_
- ✅ No extra setup needed — just start building!

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use **Bootstrap’s grid system** (`container`, `row`, `col-*`)
- How to apply **utility classes** for spacing, alignment, and image resizing
- How to combine Bootstrap with **custom styling**
- How to use **AI tools like GitHub Copilot** or **ChatGPT** to improve layout, debug issues, or style your code

---

## 🧪 What You’ll Do

During the lab:

1. Add the Bootstrap CDN to your HTML file (if not already added)
2. Wrap the images in a Bootstrap grid (`container`, `row`, `col-*`)
3. Apply utility classes like:
   - `img-fluid` (responsive images)
   - `mb-3`, `g-4`, `text-center`, `p-3` (spacing/alignment)
4. Use **AI prompts** from Copilot or the Resource Doc
5. Optionally: try hover effects, add cards, or complete the Parallax challenge

## ✅ Your Core Goals

- [ ] Build a responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Use Bootstrap layout classes and utility styles
- [ ] Use at least **one AI prompt** during the activity
- [ ] Share one improvement you made with help from AI

## 💬 Team Prompts & Reflections

- What Bootstrap class fixed a layout issue?
- What did Copilot suggest?
- What worked and what didn’t from AI-generated code?
- What’s one layout tweak you’re proud of?

## 🔼 Bonus Challenge: Level Up Options

Already nailed your tile layout? Try one of these:

### 📐 Gallery Layout

Use the wireframe example and prompt AI to match it:
> “Make this layout: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop.”

### ✨ Parallax Scroll Effect

Try a layout where the background scrolls at a different speed than the text.
